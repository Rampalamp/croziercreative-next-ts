            I have used Hardhat as a development environment for creating and
            testing smart contracts written in Slist-disc list-insideolidity. I
            am familiar with the various features and capabilities of both
            technologies, including contract testing, deployment, and debugging.
            Additionally, I have experience in creating and deploying smart
            contracts for various use cases such as token creation,
            decentralized finance and decentralized autonomous organizations
            (DAO). I am comfortable with the Solidity programming language and
            understand the security best practices and potential pitfalls when
            developing on the Ethereum blockchain. Overall, I am well-versed in
            the development and deployment of decentralized applications using
            these technologies. Here are a few github projects related to this
            experience.

            BlazorWebAssembly/Tailwindcss. It is unfinished and currently
            contains the beginnings of a Snake game built around a HTML Canvas
            and Javascript render loop.
