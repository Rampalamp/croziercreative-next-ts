                Hey. Hello. Hi there. My name is Matthew and this is my website,
                I hope you enjoy and interact (Look for INSERTIMAGE to view the
                component source code, or visit my GitHubLINK).
                <br />
                <br />
                I am a full stack software engineer with a passion for building
                scalable and efficient applications. With a strong foundation in
                software engineering and a desire to constantly learn and
                improve, I have set my phasers to 'love me' as well as
                blockchain development/technologies. Feel free to connect and
                play around in the dApp(LINK) page. Since I lack the experience,
                I am offering free Smart Contract audits. Please visit
                Audits(LINK) for more details.
                <br />
                <br />I have experience working with a variety of technologies
                including C#, JavaScript/TypeScript, SQL, GraphQL, and more(Set
                this as a link to the skills page). I am comfortable working on
                both the front-end and back-end aspects of an application and
                have an understanding of the entire development process, from
                ideation to deployment. I am also experienced working in agile
                development environments and am skilled at communicating with
                both technical and non-technical stakeholders.
