                    I have experience working with a variety of technologies
                    including C#, JavaScript/TypeScript, SQL, GraphQL, and
                    more(Set this as a link to the skills page). I am
                    comfortable working on both the front-end and back-end
                    aspects of an application and have an understanding of the
                    entire development process, from ideation to deployment. I
                    am also experienced working in agile development
                    environments and am skilled at communicating with both
                    technical and non-technical stakeholders.
