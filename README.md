## ToDo / Reminders / Notes

1. HOME
    1. Gradients work when adding color:transparent directly in the globals.css
    2. Seems to respond in size well enough
    3. Now skewed
2. SKILLS
    1. Create cloud of svgs with a grid maybe?
    2. Do something with the text blerb.
3. AUDITS
    1. Message for Audits (hopefully one day it will actually contain links or content of completed audits)
4. DAPP
    1. Sort out which smart contract interactions to tap into.
5. COMPONENTS
    1. Create ShowCode component, make it button, and perhaps just have all the code in markdown format to display in a overlayed modal when clicked?
    2. Figure out how to position the ShowCode button in the Header.tsx. Will likely need to rethink spacings at specific sizes... Might even need to increase the min width allowed, cause at 380px its pretty tight on the top bar.
    3. Do I want different colors for the code.svg when toggling light/dark theme? Might be able to achieve this relatively painlessly if use ThemeContext inside the ShowCode.tsx component.
