## ToDo / Reminders / Notes

1. HOME

    1. Gradients work when adding color:transparent directly in the globals.css
    2. Seems to respond in size well enough
    3. Now skewed

2. SKILLS

    1. Skills SVG cloud created
    2. SkillsProvider created.

3. AUDITS

    1. General content complete, for now.
    2. Links setup

4. DAPP

    1. Sort out which smart contract interactions to tap into.
    2. Create our own CCConnectButton? Or just use the web3uikit?

5. COMPONENTS

    1. CodeOverlayProvider I believe is finished, for now at least until I think some stylings are ugly.
    2. Do I want different colors for the code.svg when toggling light/dark theme? Might be able to achieve this relatively painlessly if use ThemeContext inside the ShowCode.tsx component.
    3. ThemeToggle. Should I animate the moon/sun accordingly to liek rotate 360degree on click, THEN toggle t he theme? Would be similar to the Copied Code! fading in and out on the CodeOverlayProvider
    4. CCButton created and implemented.
    5. CCMenuIcon.tsx created, SVG animates when Menu is open/closed.

6. SCRIPTS

    1. CreateCodeSnippets is good to go I think.
