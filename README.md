## ToDO

1. Svg cloud for skills page
2. Write up blerb for home page
    1. Blerb is written, need to sort out the text shifting up when width becomes smaller, it is causing the top paragraph to get cut off. Also likely should move the last paragraph, more about experience, into the Skills page. To much text on this home page I think.
3. Message for Audits (hopefully one day it will actually contain links or content of completed audits)
4. Decentralized Application - Sort out which smart contract interactions to tap into.

## Added

1. Theme toggling - Remember when changing theme colors, the SVGs need manual updating of their colors if wanting to match.
2. Fonts seem okay... for now.
3. LinkedIn/Github links
4. Side nav slide in and menu icon on small devices.
5. Final positioning/resizing for top nav done. (I think)
