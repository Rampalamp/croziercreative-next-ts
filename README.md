## ToDo / Reminders / Notes

1. HOME
    1. Gradients work when adding color:transparent directly in the globals.css
    2. Seems to respond in size well enough
    3. Now skewed
2. SKILLS
    1. Skills SVG cloud created
    2. Create a SkillsProvider and have it display text when clicking on each SVG?
3. AUDITS
    1. Message for Audits (hopefully one day it will actually contain links or content of completed audits)
4. DAPP
    1. Sort out which smart contract interactions to tap into.
5. COMPONENTS

    1. CodeOverlayProvider I believe is finished, for now at least until I think some stylings are ugly.
    2. Do I want different colors for the code.svg when toggling light/dark theme? Might be able to achieve this relatively painlessly if use ThemeContext inside the ShowCode.tsx component.
    3. For Header.tsx consider how tailwindcss has their header setup. transparent with a blur, and it takes the background of the underlying. Gets a deeper shade as soon as a scroll occurs.?
    4. CCButton created and implemented.

6. SCRIPTS
    1. CreateCodeSnippets is good to go I think.
