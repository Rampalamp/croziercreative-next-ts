## ToDO

1. Collapse to menu toggle at certain screen size
2. style so menu shows differently when in smaller views, perhaps from the side or overlay with opacity.

## Added

1. Theme toggling - Remember when changing theme colors, the SVGs need manual updating of their colors if wanting to match.
2. Fonts seem okay... for now.
3. LinkedIn/Github links
