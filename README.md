## ToDo / Reminders / Notes

1. HOME

    1. Gradients work when adding color:transparent directly in the globals.css
    2. Seems to respond in size well enough
    3. Now skewed

2. SKILLS

    1. Skills SVG cloud created
    2. SkillsProvider created.

3. AUDITS

    1. General content complete, for now.
    2. Links setup

4. DAPP

    1. Sort out which smart contract interactions to tap into.
    2. Going to attempt making our own Web3Provider of sorts. Lots of options out there, Web3uiKit, Web3Modal, RainbowKit is nice also. But they just do so much more then what I need, or how they operate confuses me. So this is a good time to learn something new more concretely.

5. COMPONENTS

    1. CodeOverlayProvider I believe is finished, for now at least until I think some stylings are ugly.
    2. Do I want different colors for the code.svg when toggling light/dark theme? Might be able to achieve this relatively painlessly if use ThemeContext inside the ShowCode.tsx component.
    3. CCThemeIcon added, with spin animation on click, toggleTheme is called onAnimationEnd attribute in CCThemeIcon
    4. CCButton created and implemented.
    5. CCMenuIcon.tsx created, SVG animates when Menu is open/closed.

6. SCRIPTS

    1. CreateCodeSnippets is good to go I think.
