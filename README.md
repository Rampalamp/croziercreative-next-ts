## ToDO

1. Svg cloud for skills page
2. Write up blerb for home page
    1. Too much text on homepage, but fixed text from overflowing behind top navbar
    2. Maybe turn the Hi Hey Hello There into really big text design with a gradient.
3. Message for Audits (hopefully one day it will actually contain links or content of completed audits)
4. Decentralized Application - Sort out which smart contract interactions to tap into.
5. Add gradients to main backgrounds??

## Added

1. Theme toggling - Remember when changing theme colors, the SVGs need manual updating of their colors if wanting to match.
2. Fonts seem okay... for now.
3. LinkedIn/Github links
4. Side nav slide in and menu icon on small devices.
5. Final positioning/resizing for top nav done. (I think)
